## What does it do??

VOCinit is an Init, specifically a TIF (temporary initialization file) that forces the VOC (Video Overlay Card) video/graphics mix settings on boot to either be full IIgs graphics or full input video.

If you have the caps lock off it will set the VOC video/graphics mix settings to full IIgs graphics.
If you have the caps lock on, it will set the VOC video/graphics mix settings to full input video.


## Installation

Copy the VOCInit file into the */SYSTEM/SYSTEM.SETUP/ directory.
(* is the name of your boot volume)

## What use is something like this?

1. Most of the time when you boot your Apple IIgs you want to to see the
    graphics from the Apple IIgs and not the video from the Video Overlay
    Card input.  With the Caps Lock off this init will ensure that your Video
    Overlay Card is set that way.

2. Sometimes you may be turning on your Apple IIgs specifically to see the
    input on your Video Overlay Card.  With the Caps Lock on this can
    allow you to easily do that.
